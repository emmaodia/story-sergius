											<p>
												My New Year message to the good people of Esan North East/South East Federal Constituency
												I join you all in giving thanks to God Almighty for bringing  us safely through the past year to the beginning of 2017, which by His
												Grace, will be a better year for us and our great federal constituency.
												In keeping with tradition, it’s usual for individuals, institutions and organizations to make resolutions and set agenda as a new year begins, to guide their actions in the coming months. Our objective for the year is to ensure by all possible means that all the programmes and projects which we have started are completed to meet the yearnings of our people. Top on the list, is the establishment of a large Constituency Farm and cottage industries. Our target is to engage not fewer than two hundred youth in the mechanized farming Scheme.  A vast  expanse of fertile farm land has been secured for this purpose and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture has graciously lent its green light to the green initiative. The farm and cottage industries, when they come on stream, would no doubt, help to ameliorate the monstrous poverty and unemployment plaguing our able-bodied young men and women with relentless fury.
												We’ll step up the pressure on relevant ministries and agencies of government to ensure the completion of the Northern Esan Water Project, rehabilitation of the Irrua-Uromi-Ubiaja-Illushi Road, Ewu-Uromi-Igueben-Agbor road, Emu-Utor Road, Ewohimi-Onicha Ugbo Road just as priority attention will be given to wealth creation and employment generation. We will continue to work diligently in 2017 to ensure that our efforts in these areas are carried forward to full fruition in fulfilment of our promise of quality representation and improved living conditions for all.
												At this juncture, permit me to take you on a quick ride through the long list of our modest achievements since you gave me the overwhelming mandate to represent your interest in the Lower Chamber of the National Assembly eighteen months ago. For the purpose of clarity and simplicity, I shall enumerate them under two broad classifications.
											<br/>
											<br/>
											LEGISLATION
											<br/>
											By the special grace of God, I have sponsored the following motions/bill on the floor of the Federal House of Representatives.
											1. Urgent need to complete and commission the Northern Ishan Water Supply Scheme.(appropriated for in the 2016 budget).
											2. Need to compel the  Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority and other relevant regulatory authorities in the Aviation Sector to conduct routine checks on the state of Aircrafts operating within Nigeria and make public the reports.
											3. A resolution for the immediate establishment of an emergency response and ambulance bay by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), at Ewu Hills, along the Benin-Abuja Federal Highway, Ewu, Edo State
											4. Urgent need to mandate the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria to beef up and strengthen  security apparatus and checks at our Nation’s Airports
											5. Need to stem the serious flooding at Illushi and Ifeku Island communities in Esan South East Local Government Area of Edo State
											6. Need to mandate the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control to check and ensure that food and drinks prepared and served in hotels, fast food restaurants and any other restaurants meet globally accepted hygiene standard
											7. Call on the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA) and the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to as a matter of urgency do rehabilitation works on the Irrua-Uromi-Ubiaja- Illushi road, Uromi-Igueben-Agbor road and the Ewohimi-Onicha Ugbo Road
											8. Urgent Need to Investigate the activities of the Nigerian Oil industry regulatory authorities and the need to complete all ongoing and outstanding utilization processes of straddled oil and gas fields and for other matters connected therewith.
											9. Need to Provide Welfare and Rehabilitation Centres for the Critically ill and Physically Challenged.

											14. Free Advice and Treatment of Breast Cancer Centre Bill 2016
											In the works. 3 new Bills
											<br/>
											<br/>
											CONSTITUENCY PROJECTS/PHILANTHROPIC GESTURES
											<br/>
										Before I proceed further, I would like us to reflect on our yesterday and ponder our today within the context of our vision for all our tomorrows. When we pause to consider where we are coming from, where we are today, and the great potentials that lie ahead in the light of the solid foundations we have laid, we can only look back and thank God for one and a half year of progress and resounding success with the following achievements/results to show for our relentless efforts.
										On assumption of office, I discovered that some constituency projects were captured in the last National Budget of the Jonathan administration. I dusted up the files and went to work immediately, and today, I am glad to inform you all that all the projects have been completed. They include:
										* A block of six classrooms at Iruele Primary School, Uromi
										* A block of three classrooms at Ukpekimiokolo Primary School, Uromi
										* Provision of sitting furniture for a block of three classrooms at Ikeken Primary School, Uromi
										On my own part, I presented free NECO/SSCE Enrolment fees to six hundred(600) final year secondary school students on 6th February, 2016, awarded full university scholarship to the overall best six candidates in the SOOF 2015/2016 Free NECO/SSCE Enrolment Test and dstributed over three hundred thousand (300,000) free notebooks to all public and private nursery/primary/secondary schools in the Federal Constituency in September 2016, with each pupil/student receiving five notebooks each.
										I also presented Free NECO/SSCE Enrolment Fees to Six Hundred(600) final year secondary school students on 31st January 2015, awarded Full University Scholarship to the six overall best candidates in the 2014/2015 SOOF FREE NECO Enrolment Test, distributed over three hundred thousand (300,000) free notebooks to all public and private nursery/primary/secondary schools in the federal constituency in September 2015 and presented a cash award of #100,000 and #50,000 respectively to the best Graduating Esan ND Student and Best Graduating Esan HND student of Auchi Polytechnic in December, 2015. In June 2015, I offered scholarship to 187 students drawn from the 21 wards that make up our constituency to study various courses under the four months Intensive Training Programme of the National Institute of Construction  Technology Uromi.
										Away from education, we have been able to secure employment/appointments for scores of graduates from Agbazilo while over three hundred job seekers have been recommended for possible consideration.
										Propelled by the desire to strengthen existing local primary health care facilities and to reposition them to function optimally, I facilitated the provision of modern health care equipment/accessories worth millions of naira for Uzogbon Primary Health Centre Ugboha, Illushi Primary Health Centre Illushi and Olinlin Primary Health Centre, Uzea.
										In line with our avowed commitment to safeguarding the welfare, wellness and wellbeing of our people, we have so far  organized free medical programmes in eight communities including Uzea, Emu, Idumu-Okojie, Amendokhian, Oria, Ewohimi Ward 1, Ewohimi Ward 2 and Ubiaja in collaboration with the National Association of Nigerian Nurses in North America (NNANNA) and Nigerian Physicians Association of America. At the end of all the free medical outreaches, a total of fifteen thousand constituents were diagnosed and treated free of charge just as attendees went away with free eye glasses, long lasting treated mosquito nets and drugs based on the prescriptions of the doctors. The medical outreaches afforded many the opportunity to obtain solutions to their health challenges with ease, and without spending a dime.
										We successfully constructed a functional borehole at Uzea in response to the people’s demand for hygienic water. We also took deliberate steps towards ensuring the completion and inauguration of the Northern Esan Water Scheme in the preceding year 2016.
										In our drive to cushion the harsh economic realities on the ground, no thanks to the subsisting recession, and to lift our people out of the suffocating abyss of poverty, we gave out sixteen motorcycles, eleven tricycles, fifty sewing machines and 20 grinding machines to constituents in mid 2016.
										Earlier in July 2015, we had successfully organized an agro seminar where over 200 farmers where trained on how to produce numerous recipes from cassava ,cocoyam and fruits by resource persons from the National Root Crops Research Institute Umudike, Abia State. We did all these to demonstrate our resolve to teach the people how to fish instead of giving them fish to eat. When you give fish to a man, you feed him for one day. But when you teach him how to fish, you have fed him for life. I am glad to inform you all that one of the participants at the week-long training seminar has since commenced the production of natural juice on a commercial scale at Ewohimi.
										In August 2015, the first ever music talent hunt in the federal constituency was organized and among other mouthwatering benefits, the best three contestants were rewarded with a recording deal and cash prizes of  #200,000, #100,000 and #50,000 for the Star Winner, 1st Runner Up and Second Runner Up respectively.
										Time will fail me to mention all the good things we have done and are doing, to make life better for the people. We shall do a proper constituency briefing before mid-2017 to unveil our score card and take your suggestions on how we can achieve much more.

										The task of making our constituency a much better place for present and future generations cannot be left to government alone, leaders and followers alike have critical roles to play in our match towards the fulfilment of our great potentials. To this end, I urge that you all include in your new year resolutions, a commitment to do more to support our efforts in every way possible.
										Let us therefore resolve as we celebrate the New Year to place the higher interests of peace, unity, progress and development above all other considerations.
										I wish you all a happy and rewarding 2017.
